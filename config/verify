# HOW-TO:
#  1) For auto-detection of number of cores used during analysis provide "general.cores = 0", otherwise specify number of cores.
#  2) Specify the amount of RAM to be used for the internal computation on BDDs (given in GB by "general.memory").
#  3) Specify the level of verbosity:
#     - 0: off (report results only)
#     - 1: on (report results and details)
#  4) List all Designs Under Test (DUTs) under "circuit.dut" (with spaces as separating character).
#  5) Variate: defines univariate, bivariate, ... (1,2,...)
#  6) Specify the location of the fault mapping that should be used (mapping)
#  7) Specify the location where faults should be injection (location: c, s, cs)
#  8) blacklist: points to a txt file that contains a list of all entities that should be excluded
#  9) reduced_complexity: 0: disable - 1: naive - 2: aggrassive - 3: conservative
# 10) correction_based: false: detection-based countermeasure, true: correction-based countermeasure
# 11) interrupt: true: verification is interrupted if an effective fault is detected - detailed report of fault location, mapping, and input vectors
